Datasets are in data folder:

dataset contains data with the unoptimized algorithm. (reachable but without checking of common element at each depth, only when bound is reached)

dataset_alt contains data with the optimized algorithm.

workloadopt is the set of query to test the workload optimizer algorithm.

Depth is the search depth when the algorith terminates.


reachable_no_opt.pkl is the prediction model, based on RF and the algorithm reachable.reachable
